# Library-Management

This is a console based library management system. Two model classes are Book and User.
User contains personal details and a list to Books which the user have borrowed.
Book has name and auther name.

When a user borrows a book, the book details will be added to the user's books list.
And when the user returns the book, the book details will be removed from the user's books list.

Books data is stored as a .dat file and Users data also stored as a .dat file.

To store a user's books list a another .dat file is created with same name as the user's name.
In that file all the books data is written.
